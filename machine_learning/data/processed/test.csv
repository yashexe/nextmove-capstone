Work,question about our meet up time dear team lead i am writing to you today with a question i was looking at my schedule and wondering if it would be possible to maybe push the time of our meeting next week i am ever so sorry to bring this up because i understand these times must have been organized ahead i have just realized that there may be a conflict on my part with another thing happening not work related the meeting time at current would mean that i would either be missing the entire duration or that i have to leave half way through which i would not prefer to happen for the other people who also need to attend and i believe that this would create a disadvantage if i can not receive the information in full at all and so on so with that in mind i humbly ask that it would be alright to consider alternative times please take a look and consider if it can not be done i fully understand it too thank you for your precious time and have a good day and please forgive my intrusion sincerely
